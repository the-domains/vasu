A Feature Film in Hindi/English 

INDORICA 

Summary • LANGUAGE Hindi/English • GENRE Slice of Life Drama • SETTING New York & Suburbs • MARKETS India and Abroad • AUDIENCE Cross generational • CAST Ensemble • REFERENCE FILMS Life in a metro, Crash 

Synopsis Set in and around New York City, Indorica is a slice-of-life drama that depicts the convergence of four diverse but interconnected Indian stories in America on a fateful winter day. ASIF, an idealistic Indian American studying medicine and Islamic studies and SAMATA, an agnostic Kashmiri Pandit are in love and have to convince their respective parents to bless their union. Asif's father ASLAM is a devout Muslim who has been wrongly arrested by the police and Samata's mother VIDYA who lost her husband to Islamic terrorists many years ago are not willing to budge. 

Synopsis (Contd.) MANISH PATEL, an illegal immigrant has to drive to the airport without a license to pick up his wife arriving from India on a false passport. SANJAY has to reach out and express his love to the girl of his dreams before he leaves for India the next day as his VISA expires. KRIS has to confront a racist police officer while driving to reach his boss regarding a promotion that he is being bypassed for in favor of a white American. All these four stories crisscross and converge towards an unpredictable ending. 

Director's Statement Indorica was born based on my own experiences of living in America. What struck me is the isolation that people feel at an existential level in America even while living in cosmopolitan environments like that of New York and working amidst diverse groups of people. It seemed much more like islands of people rather than like a cohesive unity of people. The script explores the Indo American experience through a collage of four intertwining stories. The stories reveal the diversity of the Indian experience in America chronicling identity crises, prejudices, and the blurring of lines between victims and perpetrators. The stories also explore different types of love ranging from an affair to long term separation to a one night stand to a pair of young lovers willing to throw away everything to start a life together. These are themes that are very close to my heart and I yearn to tell these stories. 

Writer-Director Vasu Vangala Trained in acting, writing, and directing in New York at the HB Studio and New York University, Vasu worked as a Director's Assistant and Cast Member on BEEPER, an INDO-US Co- Production starring Harvey Keitel.
