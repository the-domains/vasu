This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Great Barrier Reef's Best Hope Is a Killer Robot</h1><p>Crown-of-thorns starfish are the zombies of the sea. They won't die even if you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df2ff642b24f92833cf4da9277a687034f647587.jpg"></article>]]></description>
