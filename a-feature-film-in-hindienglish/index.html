ASIF, an idealistic Indian American studying medicine and Islamic studies and SAMATA, an agnostic Kashmiri Pandit are in love and have to convince their respective parents to bless their union. Asif’s father ASLAM is a devout Muslim who has been wrongly arrested by the police and Samata’s mother VIDYA who lost her husband to Islamic terrorists many years ago are not willing to budge. </p><p>Synopsis (Contd.) MANISH PATEL, an illegal immigrant has to drive to the airport without a license to pick up his wife arriving from India on a false passport. SANJAY has to reach out and express his love to the girl of his dreams before he leaves for India the next day as his VISA expires. KRIS has to confront a racist police officer while driving to reach his boss regarding a promotion that he is being bypassed for in favor of a white American. All these four stories crisscross and converge towards an unpredictable ending. </p><p>Director’s Statement Indorica was born based on my own experiences of living in America. What struck me is the isolation that people feel at an existential level in America even while living in cosmopolitan environments like that of New York and working amidst diverse groups of people. It seemed much more like islands of people rather than like a cohesive unity of people. The script explores the Indo American experience through a collage of four intertwining stories. The stories reveal the diversity of the Indian experience in America chronicling identity crises, prejudices, and the blurring of lines between victims and perpetrators. The stories also explore different types of love ranging from an affair to long term separation to a one night stand to a pair of young lovers willing to throw away everything to start a life together. These are themes that are very close to my heart and I yearn to tell these stories. </p><p>Writer-Director Vasu Vangala Trained in acting, writing, and directing in New York at the HB Studio and New York University, Vasu worked as a Director’s Assistant and Cast Member on BEEPER, an INDO-US Co- Production starring Harvey Keitel. Harvey Keitel optioned his Feature Script, CARCIN. He was also hired by Ben Rekhi to adapt the novel, ‘Keep off the Grass’. Vasu’s Short Film UNTOLD produced by Sanjay Suri won the Best Short Film award at the Washington DC South Asian Film Festival. It was also nominated for Best Short Film at the Mahindra Indo American Film Festival in New York (now, NYIFF) and shown on the opening night at the London Asian Film Festival. </p><p>Dialogues-Lyrics Niranjan Iyengar A staple of Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions, Niranjan worked as a writer and lyricist on blockbusters like Kal Ho Na Ho, My Name is Khan, Wake up Sid, and Student of the Year as well as new age thrillers like D-Day.
